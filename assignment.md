# Overview
The objective of this assignment is to redesign and redo web application components of "Login" use case in the Student Registration System that we have developed in the Assignment for Module # 3 and replace those with JSF based solution.

# Requirements:
1. Design and develop JSF components, views, managed beans, etc., whatever you think is necessary to implement "Login" use case described in the Assignment for Module # 3. Be creative in utilizing JSF validation, JSF navigation, Facelets, etc., as appropriate. 

2. Leave other components of your application in their current state as you submit this assignment. Please be advised that we don't need to use RegistrationControllerServlet Java servlet in front of the JSF, since the JSF is "user-facing" by itself and also JSF does include "flow control" capabilities. 

# What to submit:
Please create and submit one 'master' jar file containing:

* a README file with your name and assignment number;
* all the JSF components, managed beans, configuration files that you developed;
* all screen shots of user screens during run-time of your application;
* an instruction of how to deploy and to run your application.
