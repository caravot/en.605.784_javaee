This assignment is intended to familiarize you with JDBC technology. For this assignment you will be working on connecting to a database and performing basic data operations. By the way, this assignment is the first step towards putting together the Java EE-based application. As you progress through the course working on subsequent assignments you will learn step by step how to create, enhance, and enrich the Java EE application. The assignment is divided into three parts.

So, let's get started.

Important note: WebLogic Server is packaged with PointBase database. However, I would like students to work with Apache Derby database. This is very popular database, an open source project, being used with numerous products.

You can visit the following links on the Apache website to read more about this database:

http://db.apache.org/derby/
http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html
and to download this product (along with the documentation package) to your local drive. make sure to download the latest version (at the time of writing it is version 10.14.1.0).

After downloading (presumably, you will download db-derby-10.14.1.0-bin.zip file), unzip this file into your C:\db-derby-10.14.1.0-bin directory.

Now you are ready to start working with the Derby database. Please make sure to include its main jar file, derby.jar (located in c:\db-derby-10.14.1.0-bin\lib directory) into CLASSPATH before running any program that is going to use it (including the WebLogic Server itself).

Now, read the attached Assignment Instructions PDF for details on the three parts of this assignment. The .java files will come into play in the second part.

What to Submit
Please create and submit one 'master' jar file containing:

All the screen shots taken for all steps of the assignment.
All the Java source code and class files you created for assignments in Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.
config.xml file of the WLS with DataSource object defined.
Please also include entire directory structure with all subdirectories and files of JHU database that you have used (it is critical for grading your submission).
A text-based README file including your name and describing content of your submission.
Submit your file to this Assignment item.
